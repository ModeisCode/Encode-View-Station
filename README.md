# Encode-View-Station
This project aims to compress and decompress files with using huffman code algorithm. (This project is free and open source) WARNING! This project is under development and has some issues with compressing file.

  User guide:

  
    For encoding , first you must import some file for instance a file that has extensions .cpp or .txt , then select the file after that you can simply press to encode/decode button. This program is saving 3 files. I will explain about them later.

    
    For decoding , select the .fre file where you have saved the .fre file , Subsequently select the file as same as for encoding part. Select the encoded root file that has extension .root and it's done.

    
  3 file types:

  
    FRE: FRE files has extension .fre that holds binary data compressed.

    
    ROOT: ROOT files has extension .root , it's purpose holds some data for decompressing.

    
    <your_file_name>: This file contains ascii representation of binary.
